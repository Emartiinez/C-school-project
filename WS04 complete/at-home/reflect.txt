1)What is a safe empty state? Could you define another state as the safe empty state? 

An empty state means that an object should be ready to use once the constructed. 
Another way to define a state as the safe empty state is to initialize to null.




2)Describe how you have minimized code duplication. 

In my opinion, the way you used to minimize repetition of code is to create functions which will substitute any duplication.


3)Explain why the canTravelWith(...) member function can access the pri-vate data of the object referenced in its parameter.

In my opinion, it is part of the same class so it can directly access all private data members of the same class. 


4)What statement do you need to add to ensure that the strncpy(...) func-tion executes correctly? 

Strncpy you need 3 arguments using this function. To make this work you must ensure the length of the string. Strncpy(desitination, source , stringLength)/


5)Explain what you have learned in this workshop. 

I have learned to properly declare constructors which are used to set data in objects.  
I learned how the program can distinguish which constructor is being used by the number of parameters it contains.
