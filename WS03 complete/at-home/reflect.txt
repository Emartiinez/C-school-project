1)How many elements are there in each C-style character string that stores a family or given name for the account? Why? 

	In the char string for family and given name contains 40 elements that comes from the const int max_name_length, but does not include the null byte.  
	The reason is because it is always better to save extra memory in the program when it comes to enter user names.


2)Your class declares two member functions named set(...). In C, this would generate an error. Name the feature of C++ that allows this. 


	The feature of C++ that allows you to have 2 different class members named set is functions signature, 
	which identifies the overload function and distinguishes the different types by its parameters. 

3)What have you learned during this workshop? 

	In my opinion, the set function was one of the trickiest code I had to figure out both 1st semester and 2nd semester so far. 
	I have learned how to overload a function and how to use it.  Define different class types and learned to privatize data. 
	This workshop made it comfortable for me to understand class and member functions.
