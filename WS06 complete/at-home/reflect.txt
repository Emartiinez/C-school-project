1)Why does the copy assignment operator check for self-assignment before doing anything else? 

In my opinion the reason why, the copy assignment operator checks for self-assignment before doing anything else to make sure that the object being copied is valid. 

2) List how you avoided duplication of code. 
Throughout this workshop there was plenty of duplication in this code and a few ways to minimize duplication was by creating extra member functions and helper functions as well. 

3) List what you have learned in completing this workshop. 
In this workshop I have learned how to define a copy constructor and understanding the functionality behind it.  We learned how to use member operators in this workshop and how to copy objects using the operators.
