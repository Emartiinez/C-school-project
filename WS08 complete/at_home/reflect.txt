1.	What is the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class? 

In my opinion the difference between abstract base class and concrete class is that abstract classes are classes that defines an interface of a program, 
while a concrete class is known to be a derived from that interface class.

2.	Identify the functions that shadow functions of the same name in your solution? 

A few functions that shadow functions of the same name are all the virtual functions declared in the interface file which is the iAccount.h. 
The following functions that were shadow were the credit, debit, monthend and display function.

3. Explain what you have learned in this workshop. 
	
What I learned from completing this workshop is how to properly define abstract classes that have pure virtual functions.
I heave learned the difference between an abstract and a concrete class.
