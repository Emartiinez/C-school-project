1.	What is a namespace? Explain its purpose. 

In my opinion namespace is used to declare specific functions, types or even variables, namespace defines a scope. It’s purpose its organize code to its proper code block logic, using the same name but with causing any conflict in the program.


2.	Why are header files needed? Explain. 

The purpose of header files is to create your own library functions of prototypes. It is easier to create a separate file and to include it to the main file, rather than having everything in one main file.


3.	In the instructions above, you were directed to compile only .cpp files but not the .h files. Explain why you should never compile header files. 

In my opinion the reason you do not compile header files is because it is already implemented in the .cpp files. 


4.	Explain why you should never include .cpp files in another file. 

In my opinion, the reason you do not include .cpp files in another file is because it is the body of the .h file and is already being included in the .h files. 
	
5.	Explain in your own words what have you learned on this workshop. 

What I have learned in workshop 1 is learning what namespace is and how to properly use it and declare it and how it is useful to use in your source code. I also learned how to the safeguard way if you already have #include .h in different files using #ifndef and #endif.
