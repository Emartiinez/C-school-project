1.	Does the Hero class need to know about the existence of the SuperHero class? (Hint: do a search in Hero.cpp, does the word “SuperHero” appear anywhere?)

In my opinion,  the class Hero does not need know be aware about the derived class SuperHero mainly because Hero class is the parent class and the SuperHero is inheriting from the Hero class. 

2.	Does the SuperHero class need to know about the existence of the Hero class? (Hint: do a search in SuperHero.cpp, does the word “Hero” appear anywhere?)

I do believe that the SuperHero class because it is the derived class meaning it inherits from the parant class which is the Hero class. 
The Hero.h file is included in the SuperHero.h file.
  
3. The program prints out “Ancient Battle!” when 2 Heroes fight. It prints out “Super Fight!” when SuperHeroes fight. When you tried to make a Hero fight a SuperHero, what did it print out?

In the program when it printed out the fight between hero and superhero the text Ancient battle was printed out before the hero and superhero.

4. True or False: are the following definitions for main valid? 

int main() {
 Hero("Achilles", 20, 6) * Hero("Hector", 30, 5);
 }
 how about this? 
int main() {
 (Hero("Achilles", 20, 6) * Hero("Hector", 30, 5)) * 
 (Hero("Atalanta", 10, 3) * Hero("Hippolyta", 10, 2));

In my opinion I do not think that neither of this main will work mainly because to calculate the winner in the fights the program calls non friend operator function in used in both implementation files.
